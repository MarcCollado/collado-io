‚ÑπÔ∏è This is not a newsletter, nor is it a weekly update one can expect to be delivered every Sunday. These are just random thoughts or ideas I come across and pin down during the week.

## Found on the "news"

- This week has been mostly about the [Apple Event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b13xnFp_LJs). All my thoughts [here](https://www.radiolanza.com/episodes/s2b1).
- Oh, no, there's more. Game changer. [Notion now supports in-line sub-pages](https://www.notion.so/What-s-New-157765353f2c4705bd45474e5ba8b46c). Quote from the changelog: before, sub-page links had to be their own standalone content blocks on their own lines. Now you have the option to nest a sub-page right inside a paragraph.

## Things I've shared

- This wasn't Big Sur' week. Not yet. However, one doesn't need an excuse to [geek out with the system preferences](https://www.arun.is/blog/system-preferences/).
- Speaking of preferences. I've always thought there should be a hidden toggle (buried five levels deep under the Settings > Accessibility menu, don't care) that defers your update cycle until the `.1` comes out. This week I learned that Apple has, for years, implemented a [better, subtler approach](https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1306413329544605698?s=20) to do precisely that.
- _A priori_ not sure how to feel about _resonating_ with most of this [Nerd Urban Dictionary](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1mQMKJMN9LlIy4uPQB90nO76BLKhrInEyV-ESbTJetkQ/mobilebasic) _set_ of words.
- If only I could [play Factorio](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1306491844512026624) on that, I might even consider [buying one](https://twitter.com/jonyiveparody/status/1303412612466704386?s=21).

## Things I was into

> The modern mind is overstimulated and the modern body is understimulated and overfed. Meditation, exercise, and fasting restore an ancient balance.

- Been thinking a lot [about this](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1158966154892697602?s=20) ‚òùÔ∏è lately. We have over-complicated society to an extent that we've lost touch with the [most fundamental stuff our ancestors had already figure out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_sana_in_corpore_sano).
- One of the main reasons why we tend to over-eat (over-everything, for that matter) is no other than our primate wiring still being anchored in a world of scarcity. There are plenty of lessons to be learned in [this episode of Solvable](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/food-waste-is-solvable/id1463448386?i=1000442789243) with Tristram Stuart.
- Even applied for the [private beta of Levels](https://www.levelshealth.com) ‚Äî a CGM to track your blood glucose in real-time.

## Random thoughts

- üé≤ Why most of the classic board games haven't been "upgraded" with AR capabilities? Think of the potential applications and the enhanced experience. Picture a (say, trivial, chess...) board with an AR-enabled mobile device placed on top of a tripod in front of each player. The AR layers a new "world" on top of the board that only the player sees, but still both devices are interconnected. You keep the offline experience and adds a set of features that are literally not possible in "our reality".
- üîç The marketing team of Elastic is one of the more undervalued assets out there. Listen to any conversation around an application lacking the search feature. Rest assure it will inevitably end up with the random guy next to you claiming "easy, just implement Elastic Search and you're good to go".
