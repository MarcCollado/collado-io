Despite having been written more than three decades, the core idea captured in [Amusing Ourselves to Death](/blog/2021/amusing-ourselves-to-death), by Neil Postman, remains astonishingly relevant today. Although his historical views ended at the age of television, it closely describes our current state of affairs. Presumably, at the time of its publication, it might have been perceived as an overstatement, yet with the benefit of hindsight, it has fallen short of dystopia.

Along these lines, I recently stumbled upon [The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0393339750/) by Nicholas Carr. His book can be considered an extension to Postman's.

Carr makes a similar case, that every information technology carries an intellectual ethic â€• a set of assumptions about the nature of knowledge and intelligence. Similarly, he also explains how the printed book served to focus our attention, promoting deep and creative thought. Yet in stark contrast, the Internet encouraged the rapid, distracted sampling of small bits of information from many sources.

Internet's ethic has become that of an industrialist, an ethic of speed and efficiency, of optimized production and consumption and, as a society, the Internet is remaking us in its own image. We are becoming ever more adept at scanning and skimming, but what we are losing is our capacity for concentration, contemplation, and reflection.

Our brains, the historical and scientific evidence reveals, change in response to our experiences. The technologies we use to find, store, and share information can literally reroute our neural pathways.

My own inability to focus initially attracted me to The Shallows. The book revealed that I'm not alone. Unlike before, when we get immersed in a book and focus on it entirely, we no longer focus for long anymore. The Internet not only has dramatically shorten our attention spans, but got us addicted in ways we didn't see coming.

For most of us who transitioned from an "analog youth" to a "digital adulthood", we are now able to focus less, and get distracted more easily. The Internet has changed our brains in terms of adaptation. Continually using the internet gets us to like it more, regardless of how much you must have hated it from the start.

Our brain now lives in a permanent state of distraction. For our ancestors, maximum concentration and focus were required for reading. This is why reading actually helped humans develop the productivity of their brain massively.

One of the reasons mentioned above to justify the printed word domination was its lack of competition. Printed matter was virtually all that was available. However, nowadays it is the Internet who enjoys this domination, since it has been embedded in almost any aspect of our life.

This ubiquity is only worsened by its highly addictive nature. The level of interactivity people experience is continuously engaging our reward system, making us very aware and conscious of our social status. On top of that, the Internet has a way of capturing our attention, and not stopping there; it will divide the attention to various dimensions so that we'll be interested in a lot of things.
