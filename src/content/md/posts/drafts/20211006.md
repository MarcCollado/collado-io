## Being Wrong Less

- **Inverse thinking**: think of problems from an "inverse" perspective to unlock new solutions — i.e. instead of following a healthy diet, avoid unhealthy options.
- **Unforced error**: mistakes made by our poor judgement.
- **Antifragile**: there is no word for the opposite of fragile; beyond resilience, resists the shock and gets better.

### KISS

> The simplest explanation is most likely to be true.

- **Arguing from first principles**: thinking from the bottom up and avoid conventional wisdom — i.e. the story of the Apollo 13: build it with what you have.
  - **De-risk**: validate and test your principles with assumptions.
  - Use an **MVP** to test your hypothesis and also avoid premature optimization.
- [**Ockham's razor**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor): but don't come up with too many over-complicated assumptions, since the simplest explanation is most likely to be true.
  - [**Conjunction fallacy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy): we tend to think that something specific is more probable than something general — i.e. Linda is a bank teller that also...
  - **Overfitting**: explaining data with too many assumptions when a simpler explanation would do.
- **Frame of reference**: you see everything from your perspective.
- [**Availability bias**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic): you see "only" the information made available to you — i.e. relying too much on recent events or over-estimating the likelihood of certain events based on their media coverage.
  - **Framing**: manipulation of how to present information in a given situation. Modulate your discourse according to the recipients frame.
  - [**Anchors**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)>): relying too much on first impressions — i.e. The Economist subscription.
  - **Nudging** — i.e. the highlight on the restaurant menu.
  - On the Internet these biases can result in [**filter bubbles**](https://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles?language=en). And if you put many of them together and you get an **echo chamber**.

### Walk a mile in their shoes

> Never attribute to malice what can be explained by carelessness.

- **Fundamental attribution error**: attributing others' behaviors to their internal (or fundamental) motivations, rather than external factors — i.e. thinking someone was mean rather than simply having a bad day. We can attempt to overcome such bias with:
  - The **third story**: the one an impartial observer would recount — i.e. agree that you and the other person see things differently.
  - **Most Respectful Interpretation** (MRI): interpret the other parties' actions in the most respectful way.
  - [**Hanlon's razor**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor): never attribute to malice what can be explained by carelessness.
  - **Veil of ignorance** (original position): try to put yourself in the other person shoes.
- [**Self-serving bias**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias): flipping FAE ☝️, we tend to view the world the opposite way, and always generate self-serving reasons to justify our behavior.
- **Birth lottery** vs. **Just world hypothesis**: the former states that a portion of your success is due to luck, when the latter proposes that you simply reap what you sow.
- [**Learned helplessness**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness): stop trying to escape difficult situations just because we are used to. It also manifests as believing we are incapable of _fill in the blank_.

### Progress, one funeral at a time

> You must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool.

—— Richard Feynman

- **Paradigm shift**: new explanations are either ignored or rationalized away.
- [**Confirmation bias**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias): gather and interpret new information to confirm preexisting beliefs.
  - **Backfire effect**: confirmation bias brought to its extreme.
  - **Disconfirmation bias**: the opposite of the confirmation, impose a stronger burden of proof on ideas you don't want to believe.
- All the above can be explained by [**cognitive dissonance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance): the stress of holding two contradictory beliefs at the same time.

> I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don't know the other side's argument better than they do.

—— Charlie Munger

- Fight confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance by **thinking gray**. Avoid binary judgments, be patient, and when possible, delay your decision. Keep your options open to gather more information — or **devil's advocate** position.

### Don't trust your gut

- **Proximate vs. Root cause**: the thing that immediately caused something to happen vs. the real reason why something happened.
  - Use **postmortems** and the **5 Whys** technique to get to the root cause.
- **Optimistic probability bias**: you want something to be true so badly that you fool yourself into believing it.

## Anything That Can Go Wrong, Will

### Harm thy neighbor, unintentionally

- [**Tyranny of small decisions**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_small_decisions): a number of decisions, individually small and insignificant in size and time perspective, cumulatively result in a larger and significant outcome which is neither optimal nor desired.
- **Free rider problem** (and **herd immunity**): someone get a "free ride" by using a resource w/o paying for it — i.e. people who cheat on their taxes or those who don't get a vaccine.
- All the above can cause phenomena such as the [**tragedy of the commons**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons).
- **Externalities**, which are consequences that affect an entity w/o its consent, occur when there are **spillover effects**.
  - Fix them, or internalize these externalities: **Coase theorem** or **cap-and-trade**.

### Risky business

- **Moral hazard**, or why you drive recklessly on a rental car, happens when you take on more risk once you have information that encourages you to believe you are more protected.
- **Principal-agent problem**: the self-interest of the agent may lead to suboptimal results for the principal — occur when there is an **asymmetry of information** — i.e. real estate agents.
  - **Adverse selection**: when parties select transactions that think will benefit them based on private information — i.e. seeking dental insurance when you know you'll need it.
- All the above are signs of **market failures**: markets that w/o intervention create suboptimal results. But also interventions can fail: **government failure**, or **political failure.**

### Be careful what you wish for

Think ahead about what behaviors are you incentivizing by your actions.

- **Goodhart's (and Campbell's) law**: when a measure becomes the target, it ceases to be a good measure. When you try to incentivize a behavior by setting a measure target, people will focus on achieving that measure — it creates **perverse incentives**.
  - Popular examples are the **Cobra, Hydra, or Streisand effect** — when changing a system always anticipate and account for how people may respond.
- **Observer effect (also chilling effect)**: there is an effect on something depending on how or who is observing it — i.e. employees dressing nicer when the boss comes and visits or online traffic for terrorism dropping when you know the government is watching.
  - When the chilling effect has negative, unintended consequences it is called **collateral damage**.
  - When collateral damage impacts the entity that inflicted the damage in the first place, it is called **blowback**.

### It's getting hot in here

Think of the long-term consequences of short-term decisions and avoid potential existential risks.

- **Boiling frog**: unintended consequences likely to arise when you focus on the short-term (**short-termism**). Good short-term decisions that add up to a bad outcome — i.e. focus on on the quarterly results rather than a five year goal.
- Consequences of short-termism can lead to **technical** (design, diversity, or whatever) **debt**.
  - **Path-dependence**: path or decisions available to you are now dependent on past decisions. Its opposite is **preserving optionality**: making choices that preserve future options. However, preserving options must be done in moderation, since it requires more resources.
  - To find the right balance between path-dependance and optionality, define a **precautionary principle** — i.e. _do no harm_.

### Too much of a good thing

- Today we are confronted by diseases of abundance such as **information overload** that might lead to **analysis paralysis** or **perfect is the enemy of good**.
  - By not making a decision, you're making a decision: you're choosing the status quo. Balance this model with thinking gray by categorizing decisions as either **reversible or irreversible decisions**.
- **Hick's law**: the number of choices logarithmically increases the decision time and anxiety, **paradox of choice** — i.e. if you want people to make quick decisions, reduce choices.
- On the other hand, making too many decisions can lead to **decision fatigue**.

## Spend Your Time Wisely

- Guide your actions and orient yourself with a **North Star**.
- The rich gets richer: **compound interest** does not only apply to capital, but also to knowledge, skills, and network.

### You can do anything, but not everything

- Beware of **two-front wars**: use **deep work**, avoid **multi-tasking** and focus on the **top idea in your mind** by tackling one high-concentration activity at a time.
- Use the **Eisenhower Decision Matrix** to prioritize tasks according to its importance and urgency.
- **Bike-shedding**: inspired by both **Parkinson and Sayre's law**, it explains why we tend to give disproportionate weight to trivial issues, since we have more "opinions" on them because they are easy.
- Factor in **opportunity cost**, the value of the best alternative opportunity you didn't choose. Also in negotiations, always go in by knowing the **BATNA**.

### Getting more bang for your buck

- Identify **high-leverage activities** through the **Pareto principle**.
  - Despite HLA won't always be the best fit, they usually have the lowest opportunity cost.
  - 80/20 arrangement of outcomes is known as a **power law distribution**. Where few occurrences accrue for an outsized proportion of the total.
- When each additional hour produces less impactful results, we've hit the law of **diminishing returns or utility**. Then beyond a certain point the function can move from diminishing to **negative returns**.

### Get out of your own way

Leverage helps us spend time on the right activities. The biases in this section are all about getting these activities done in a timely manner.

- **Present bias**: we overvalue the near-term rewards in the present over making incremental progress on the long-term. Everybody "discounts" the future and when you cast this fee as a percentage, it is called **discount rate**.
- To determine future value, apply **discounted cash flow** to determine any asset's future value. Then adding up discounted earnings together, we get **net present value**.
- **Commitments** or **default choices** can help you move easily towards the long-term goals. They act as **forcing functions**.

Once procrastination has been overcome, the next thing to do is to plan time effectively.

- The following concepts all highlight that we are bad estimating when things will get done.
  - **Parkinson's law**: work expands to fill the time available for its completion.
  - **Hofstader's law**: it always takes longer than you expect, even when you account for Hofstader's law.
  - The first 90% of the code accounts for 90% of the time, and the remainng 10% of the code, accounts for the other 90% of the time.

Beware and periodically revisit what we call "done". The best time to call something done is usually much earlier than it usually happens.

- We might avoid killing a project because that would admit the loss of the efforts to that point. **Loss aversion** explains why we are more inclined to avoid loses than we want similar gains.
- When it comes to loses, we need to acknowledge that they already happened. The **sunk-cost fallacy** is clouding our decision making. The costs of a given project — including the time spent — have already been sunk.

### Shortcut your way to success

> Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.

- When you start something new, there is no need to reinvent the wheel. Look for **design patterns**, best practices, reusable solutions to design problems that have worked in the past — i.e. off-the-shelf solutions.
  - Its opposite, the **anti-pattern** is an intuitive but ineffective solution.
- **Brute force** refers to solutions that don't require an intellectually sophisticated method. They can be effective for small-scale problems. You can scale brute force by **throwing money at the problem**. However, eventually complex enough problems will require more sophisticated solutions.
- A first approach to optimize brute force would be to use an **heuristic**. Once the solution becomes unwieldy, it is time for an **algorithm**. Most algorithms operate as **black boxes** where you only care about inputs and outputs, but the inner operations are not understood.
- When we face the problem again and again, despite its high cost of setup, we might consider **automation**. It takes advantage of **economies of scale**, when an operation becomes more efficient as its size increases.
- To speed things up consider **parallel processing**, an example of divide and conquer strategy — breaking the problem down to independent components and handing them out to different parties to solve.
- **Reframing the problem** can help open up the solution space.

## Becoming one with nature

- **Natural selection**, the process that drives biological evolution explains how traits that provide reproductive advantages are naturally selected over time. It also drives societal evolution, and we must adapt to changing environmental pressures to be successful in life.
  - Apply an experimental mindset and use the **scientific method** to stay among the fittest. Keep experimenting and you'll get closer to the optimal setup.

### Don't fight nature

$$inertia = f(mass)$$

$$momentum = velocity * mass$$

- Newton's first law of motion or **Inertia**: object's resistance to change its current state of motion. The more we hold to certain believes the more we hamper our adaptability.
  - Markets that have been around for a long time have more inertia.
  - This idea brought to business strategy can lead to suboptimal decisions or **strategy tax**. You should avoid locking yourself into rigid long-term strategies.
- **Shirky principle**: institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are a solution to.
- **The Lindy effect**: inertia in beliefs and behaviors allows entrenched ideas to persist for long periods of time. Expect life expectancy to increase the more it persists — until it reaches **peak**.
  - By this token, something with a lot of inertia, even after its peak, can take a long time to decline — think of newspaper or fax.

> Culture eats strategy for breakfast.

Or, align organization's strategy with its culture. Build a **flywheel** by establishing inertia and momentum in an adaptable culture.

- A practical example of the flywheel is that it takes a long time to become an expert on a topic, but once you're there, it takes little effort to remain on top of new developments in the field.
- Avoid multitasking — it is slow when you're starting, but once you get some momentum, your efforts will compound.

> If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

On that note, beware of changing the status quo and the resistance to change. **Homeostasis** describes a situation where an organism regulates itself around a specific target. This is why organizations always default to a set of core values.

- This is usually the reason why we stay in suboptimal arrangements for too long.
- **Potential energy**: stored with the potential to be released.
- **Center of gravity**: the point in a system around which its mass is balanced.

**Activation energy** is not the same as a **catalyst**. The former is the amount of energy you need to activate a reaction — or start something, while the latter is something that decreases this energy need or accelerates the process.
