## 6M years ago — Our last common grandmother

> We are members of a large and noisy family called the great apes. 6 million years ago, a single female ape had two daughters. One became the ancestor of all chimpanzees, the other is our grandmother.

Biologists label organisms with a two-part Latin name, genus followed by species: `families > genus > spices`.

- Spices: share same DNA pool and when they mate with each other they produce fertile offspring — i.e. bulldogs and spaniels.
- Genus: species that evolved from a common ancestor are bunched together under the heading 'genus' (plural genera). They show little sexual interest in each other and their offspring will be infertile. Hence their DNA will always move along through separate evolutionary paths — i.e. horses and donkeys produce mules, which are sterile.
- Families: trace their lineage back to a founding patriarch.

For example, lions, tigers, leopards, and jaguars are different species within the genus Panthera.

## 2.5M years ago — The genus Homo

The genus Homo evolved from an earlier genus of Apes called Australopithecus. However, prehistoric humans were insignificant animals with no more impact on their environment than gorillas, fireflies, or jellyfish.

Humans had extraordinarily large brains compared to other animals. Modern Homo sapiens sport a brain averaging 80 cubic inches, but Neanderthal's brains were even bigger and also more muscular — which disproves that natural selection favored intelligence.

It did, though, favor earlier births. And, indeed, compared to other animals, humans are born prematurely. Raising children required constant help from other members. Evolution thus also favored those capable of forming strong social ties.

- 2.5M years ago, animals much like modern humans first appeared, but for countless generations, they did not stand out from the myriad other organisms that populated the planet.
- 400K years ago, we start hunting large game.
- 300K years ago, generalized use of fire.
- 200K years ago, Homo sapiens that looked just like us first evolve in East Africa.
- 100K years ago, humans quickly jumped from the middle to the top of the food chain.
- 70K years ago, Homo sapiens from East Africa spread into the Arabian peninsula, and from there they quickly overran the entire Eurasian landmass. For some reason, our dominance as the only human species starts here.
- 10K years ago, Homo sapiens remains mostly the exclusive human species around.

From about 2.5M years ago until around 10K years ago, the world was home to several human species. Very much like today, there are many species of bears: brown bears, black bears, grizzly bears, polar bears.

We are used to thinking about ourselves as the only humans, but there were up to 6 different Homos for a long time — all of them human.

The question is: why? There are two competing theories:

- Replacement Theory: a story about genocide and different mating habits between species; implies that all living Homo sapiens have roughly the same genetic baggage, and racial distinctions among them are negligible.
- Interbreeding Theory: a story about attraction and sex, implies that there might well be genetic differences between Africans, Europeans, and Asians that go back hundreds of thousands of years. This is political dynamite, which could provide material for explosive racial theories.

It turns out we share a small percentage of genetic code with Neanderthals and Denisovans, which suggests that both theories could be right. 50k years ago, Sapiens, Neanderthals, and Denisovans were almost the same species. We were not completely different species, like horses and donkeys; but also, not just different populations of the same species, like bulldogs and spaniels.

❓ "The" question: what would have happened — from a societal point of view — if other human species were still around?

## 70K years ago — The Cognitive Revolution

The sum of cultures becomes history and brings along new ways of thinking and communicating.

> History declares its independence from biology.

It's not just our biology that brought us where we are today: the ability to rapidly change behavior opened a fast lane of cultural evolution, bypassing the traffic jams of genetic evolution — transmitting new behaviors without any need of genetic or environmental change.

The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70K years ago to 30K years ago constitutes the Cognitive Revolution, and witnessed:

- Invention of boats, oil lamps, bows and arrows, and needles.
- Evidence for religion, art, commerce, and social stratification.
- Fiction, gossip, cooperate together in common myths.
  - Ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all.
  - Gossip helped Homo sapiens to form larger and more stable bands up to 150.

Language evolved as a way of gossiping. Yet the truly unique feature of our language is the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist. This has made us the masters of creation.

> There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, no human rights, no laws, and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings.

The secret to cross the 150 mark was the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths — such as stories about gods, nations, or LLCs. Since then, Homo sapiens have been living in a dual reality.

Our brains and minds are adapted to a life of hunting and gathering. Many of our present-day social and psychological characteristics were shaped during this long pre-agricultural era. Post-industrial environments gives us more material resources and longer lives, but it often makes us feel alienated, depressed and pressured.

- 45K years ago, appearance of the firsts permanent fishing villages.
  - We colonized Australia. No other animal had ever moved into such a huge variety of radically different habitats so quickly using the same genes.
- 15K years ago we domesticated the firsts dogs.
  - The human population was smaller than that of today's Cairo.

The size of the average Sapiens brain has actually decreased since the age of foraging: the human collective now knows far more today than did the ancient bands. But at the individual level, ancient foragers were the most knowledgeable and skillful people in history.

Today, most people in industrial societies don't need to know much about the natural world in order to survive. You need to know a lot about your own tiny field of expertise, but for the vast majority of life's necessities you rely on the help of other experts, whose own knowledge is also limited to a tiny field of expertise.

They were also more fit: varied and constant use of their bodies made them as fit as marathon runners. They had physical dexterity that people today are unable to achieve.

> When agriculture and industry came along people could increasingly rely on the skills of others for survival, and new 'niches for imbeciles' were opened up. You could survive and pass your unremarkable genes to the next generation by working as a water carrier or an assembly-line worker.

Foragers seem to have enjoyed a more comfortable and rewarding lifestyle than most of the peasants, shepherds, labourers and office clerks who followed. The forager economy provided most people with more interesting lives than agriculture or industry do.

In most places and at most times, foraging provided ideal nutrition. That is hardly surprising – this had been the human diet for hundreds of thousands of years, and the human body was well adapted to it. A varied diet protected them from starvation and malnutrition.

The wholesome and varied diet, the relatively short working week, and the rarity of infectious diseases have led many experts to define pre-agricultural forager societies as 'the original affluent societies'.

## 15K years ago — The Agricultural Revolution

Following the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens acquired the technology, the organizational skills, and perhaps even the vision necessary to break out of Afro-Asia and settle the Outer World. Their first achievement was the colonization of Australia some 45,000 years ago.

The Sapiens became Pacific seafarers without growing flippers and without having to wait for their noses to migrate to the top of their heads. Instead, they built boats and learned how to steer them. No other animal had ever moved into such a huge variety of radically different habitats so quickly, everywhere using virtually the same genes.

The moment the first hunter-gatherer set foot on an Australian beach was the moment that Homo sapiens climbed to the top of the food chain and became the deadliest species ever on Earth.

The settlers of Australia, or more accurately, its conquerors, didn’t just adapt. They transformed the Australian ecosystem beyond recognition.

The big beasts of Africa and Asia learned to avoid humans, however, when the Australian fauna set eyes for the first time on us, they probably gave it one glance and then went back to chewing leaves.

At the time of the Cognitive Revolution, the planet was home to about 200 genera of large terrestrial mammals weighing over 100 pounds. At the time of the Agricultural Revolution, only about 100 remained.

Don’t believe tree-huggers who claim that our ancestors lived in harmony with nature. Long before the Industrial Revolution, Homo sapiens held the record among all organisms for driving the most plant and animal species to their extinctions. We have the dubious distinction of being the deadliest species in the annals of biology.

Even today, with all our advanced technologies, more than 90 per cent of the calories that feed humanity come from the handful of plants that our ancestors domesticated between 9500 and 3500 BC – wheat, rice, maize (called ‘corn’ in the US), potatoes, millet and barley. No noteworthy plant or animal has been domesticated in the last 2,000 years.

The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud.

The culprits were a handful of plant species, including wheat, rice and potatoes. These plants domesticated Homo sapiens, rather than vice versa.

Worldwide, wheat covers about 870,000 square miles of the globe’s surface, almost ten times the size of Britain.

Wheat did it by manipulating Homo sapiens to its advantage. This ape had been living a fairly comfortable life hunting and gathering until about 10,000 years ago, but then began to invest more and more effort in cultivating wheat. Within a couple of millennia, humans in many parts of the world were doing little from dawn to dusk other than taking care of wheat plants.

The body of Homo sapiens had not evolved for such tasks. It was adapted to climbing apple trees and running after gazelles, not to clearing rocks and carrying water buckets. Human spines, knees, necks and arches paid the price. Studies of ancient skeletons indicate that the transition to agriculture brought about a plethora of ailments, such as slipped discs, arthritis and hernias.

This completely changed their way of life. We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us.

humans are omnivorous apes who thrive on a wide variety of foods. Grains made up only a small fraction of the human diet before the Agricultural Revolution. A diet based on cereals is poor in minerals and vitamins, hard to digest, and really bad for your teeth and gums.

The early farmers were at least as violent as their forager ancestors, if not more so. Farmers had more possessions and needed land for planting.

It offered nothing for people as individuals. Yet it did bestow something on Homo sapiens as a species. Cultivating wheat provided much more food per unit of territory, and thereby enabled Homo sapiens to multiply exponentially.

The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies of DNA helixes. Just as the economic success of a company is measured only by the number of dollars in its bank account, not by the happiness of its employees, so the evolutionary success of a species is measured by the number of copies of its DNA.

If a species boasts many DNA copies, it is a success, and the species flourishes. From such a perspective, 1,000 copies are always better than a hundred copies. This is the essence of the Agricultural Revolution: the ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions.

The average person in Jericho of 8500 BC lived a harder life than the average person in Jericho of 9500 BC or 13,000 BC. But nobody realised what was happening. Every generation continued to live like the previous generation, making only small improvements here and there in the way things were done.

Why did people make such a fateful miscalculation? For the same reason that people throughout history have miscalculated. People were unable to fathom the full consequences of their decisions. Whenever they decided to do a bit of extra work – say, to hoe the fields instead of scattering seeds on the surface – people thought, ‘Yes, we will have to work harder. But the harvest will be so bountiful! We won’t have to worry any more about lean years. Our children will never go to sleep hungry.’ It made sense. If you worked harder, you would have a better life. That was the plan.

Then why didn’t humans abandon farming when the plan backfired? Partly because it took generations for the small changes to accumulate and transform society and, by then, nobody remembered that they had ever lived differently.

The pursuit of an easier life resulted in much hardship, and not for the last time. It happens to us today. How many young college graduates have taken demanding jobs in high-powered firms, vowing that they will work hard to earn money that will enable them to retire and pursue their real interests when they are thirty-five? But by the time they reach that age, they have large mortgages, children to school, houses in the suburbs that necessitate at least two cars per family, and a sense that life is not worth living without really good wine and expensive holidays abroad. What are they supposed to do, go back to digging up roots? No, they double their efforts and keep slaving away.

One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations. Once people get used to a certain luxury, they take it for granted. Then they begin to count on it. Finally they reach a point where they can’t live without it.

The story of the luxury trap carries with it an important lesson. Humanity’s search for an easier life released immense forces of change that transformed the world in ways nobody envisioned or wanted. Nobody plotted the Agricultural Revolution or sought human dependence on cereal cultivation. A series of trivial decisions aimed mostly at filling a few stomachs and gaining a little security had the cumulative effect of forcing ancient foragers to spend their days carrying water buckets under a scorching sun.
