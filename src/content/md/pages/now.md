This is a [/now page](https://nownownow.com/p/YAnl), inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org) and the [nownownow](https://nownownow.com) project.

Here you will find whatever I am currently doing, reading, learning, building... and keeps me awake at night, timely updated every now and then.

## ðŸª— The sidelines

Side projects and other things that I'm doing here and there, from time to time.

- Writing and podcasting at [Safareig](https://www.safareig.fm).
- Product advisor at Wizan Music â€” a platform connecting music artists with their fans through the blockchain.

## ðŸ“š Sitting on my desk

From books, articles, or podcasts, that I'm actively focused on or just skimming through.

- [Super Thinking](/blog/2021/super-thinking)
- [The Feynman Lectures](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu)
- [Sapiens](/blog/2021/sapiens)
- [Zero To One](/blog/2021/zero-to-one)

## ðŸ¤© Current fixations

Ideas, questions, or topics that I'm now thinking about.

- The potential applications of blockchain technology for [privacy-minded products](/tags/privacy).
- A new approach to training, with less focus on [fitness performance](/tags/sub3), optimizing instead for a longer life span.
- What we can do as individuals to prevent climate change and contribute to a more [sustainable future](/tags/minimalism).
- The impact of [cognitive biases](/tags/psychology) in our day-to-day decisions.

## ðŸ—ƒ Even more Now(s)

Despite I'm now editing this page in real-time, I used to create periodic versions for each Now. If you are curious about what I was up to in the past check out older editions of the project below.
