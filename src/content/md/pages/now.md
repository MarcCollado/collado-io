This is a [/now page](https://nownownow.com/p/YAnl), inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org) and the [nownownow](https://nownownow.com) project.

Here you will find whatever I am currently doing, reading, learning, building... and keeps me awake at night, timely updated every now and then.

## 👨‍🎓 Reading and Learning

- Amusing Ourselves to Death
- How to Live
- Coníferes
- Becoming Steve Jobs — 🎧 audiobook

## 👨‍🔬 Things I'm Into

- Writing and podcasting at [Safareig](https://www.safareig.fm)

## 🤹‍♂️ Random Thoughts

- Seriously considering the possibility of moving out from the city to a smaller town or even a rural area.
- Become more self-reliant: learn fundamental, primary skills, such as growing my food and energy, camping... but also be less dependant on big tech services.
