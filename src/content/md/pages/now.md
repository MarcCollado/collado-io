This is a [/now page](https://nownownow.com/p/YAnl), inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org) and the [nownownow](https://nownownow.com) project.

Here you will find whatever I am currently doing, reading, learning, building... and keeps me awake at night, timely updated every now and then.

## 🗃 Even more Now(s)

Despite I'm now editing this page in real-time, I used to create periodic versions for each Now. If you are curious about what I was up to in the past check out older editions of the project below.
