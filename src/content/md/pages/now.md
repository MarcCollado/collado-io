This is a [/now page](https://nownownow.com/p/YAnl), inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org) and the [nownownow](https://nownownow.com) project.

Here you will find whatever I am currently doing, reading, learning, building... and keeps me awake at night, timely updated every now and then.

## 👨‍🔧 The sidelines

## 👨‍🔬 Experiments and random thoughts

- Sustainability and climate change are themes that have troubled me for a long. Recently, I've decided to "take action" by proactively adopting a more conscious approach to my (already minimal) life choices.
- Along these lines, another recurrent topic has been artificial intelligence and the decisions we make around privacy. Becoming less dependent on big tech could be a start. However, I wanted to go deeper and learn fundamental, primary skills, such as growing my food.

### Things I want to learn more about

- Human empathy and negotiation techniques
- The Socratic method
- How fundamental statistics play a part in our daily decisions

## 🗃 Even more Now(s)

Despite I'm now editing this page in real-time, I used to create periodic versions for each Now. If you are curious about what I was up to in the past check out older editions of the project below.
