In 2020, [after almost five years](/blog/2020/thank-you-and-goodbye-ironhack) at Ironhack ‚Äî first [establishing Barcelona' operations](/blog/2015/hi-from-ironhack) from the ground up; then later on, in 2017, [setting up the global product team](/blog/2017/back-to-product) ‚Äî¬†it was about time to retreat to the early stage. On this occasion, the leap was even more daring. It was not only an industry I knew nothing about but also a product class I had never dealt with.

Kick-starting a product from "nada" is always a challenging endeavor. However, building something that has never been tried before on top of emergent grounds ‚Äî such as Esports ‚Äî makes things even more exhilarating.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Highlights

- Joined as early as employee #1 to "define" Gamestry's product
- Built and launched the first version of the product
- Hired, scaled, and led both the product and engineering teams
- Raised a seed round of 5M‚Ç¨ from international VCs
- Went from 0 to 3 million MAUs (as of January 2021), growing almost 100% MoM
