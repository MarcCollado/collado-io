Over the years, I have been crafting and tweaking many lists around good habits, routines, and personal values. This page is a compendium that aims to summarize and arrange them into a readable document.

It goes like this, from the north stars down to the behaviors and schedules that support and ensure the accomplishment of the former.

First, there are North Stars, the broader themes I care about the most. Second, there are the values and behaviors that reinforce each bucket they target. Honored and executed, these values and behaviors should act as the key ingredients for a life well-lived. And finally, there are the season's plannings. The ongoing goals I'm planning for or whatever I am currently doing, reading, learning, or building that keep me awake at night.

## ✨ Nurture personal relationships

I've come to realize that deeply caring for family and friends is the highest quest I can pursue. It is not only an endless source of joy and personal growth but also an opportunity to help others and give back some of the things I've learned along the way. A practice that locks in a disproportionate amount of value.

This activity is all about developing long-lasting, meaningful relationships with a handful of individuals. It has nothing to do with a vast loose network of digital acquittances — which I have nothing against.

## Core values

—— Friedrich Nietzsche

- Curious — remember that we don't see things as they are, we see them as we are.
- Educated — say thank you, even for the smallest things, and mean it.
- Effective — routinely examine what you're doing and its impact on the future.
- Enthusiastic — smile, radiate energy and passion, be a pleasure to be around.
- Generous — giving and helping others will make you happier than having.
- Grateful — life is short, don't take it for granted, all we have is a loan from Fortune.
- Honest — always tell the truth, it makes life easier.
- Humble — don't brag, let actions speak for themselves.
- Present — now is all there is, devote energy to this very moment.
- Respectful — everybody is dealing with stuff you know nothing about.
- Simple
- World class — aim to be the best at whatever you do.

_I'm incredibly lucky to be here, I'll never have another opportunity like this. Hence, do not waste time, get out and do something great, and remember that, eventually, at some point, I will be dead._

## Tactics — cultivate good habits

> Sow a thought and reap an action, sow an action and you reap a habit, sow a habit and you reap a character, sow a character and you reap a destiny.

—— Ralph Waldo Emerson

- Do it now — don't rely on the weekend.
- Don't procrastinate — work with time blocks and focus on the task at hand.
- Use the computer with a clear goal in mind — avoid multitasking.
- Switch activities — don't work on the same thing for more than `3h`.
- Turn off notifications and batch email and messaging.
- Don't read the news, they are not important — move everything to a reading list.

_Small actions compound over time — this is how an average day should look like._
