In 2020, [after five years](/blog/2020/thank-you-and-goodbye-ironhack) at Ironhack and having scaled both [Barcelona campus](/blog/2015/hi-from-ironhack) and [product global product team](/blog/2017/back-to-product), I moved on to co-found Gamestry and become its Chief Product Officer.

[Kick-starting a product](/blog/2020/hi-from-gamestry) from "nada" is always a challenging endeavor. However, building something that was never been tried before on top of the emergent Esports grounds made things even more exhilarating.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Highlights

- Built and launched the first version of the product
- Hired, scaled, and led both the product and engineering teams
- [Raised a series A round](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/05/gamestry-gets-5m-to-give-games-video-creators-a-sweeter-deal) of 5M‚Ç¨ from international VCs
- Growing from 0 to more than 6M MAUs (as of January 2022) in less than two years
