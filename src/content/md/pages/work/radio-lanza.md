[Radio Lanza](https://www.radiolanza.com) is a podcast co-hosted by Jimmy Flores and Marc Collado aiming to help entrepreneurs launch their projects. In each episode, we share our personal experiences on how to turn ideas into products.

A show that wants to inspire and encourage entrepreneurs in their next adventure. We want to guide and spare our audience some of the mistakes we've made. But also an excuse for us to geek out weekly. Interviewing amazing guests, dissecting nerdy topics, but above all, sharing our strong, controversial opinions around the products we love.

Readers familiar with Radio Lanza know that I derive almost as much pleasure curating the show notes as I do recording the podcast. At the end of the day, maybe it is all an excuse to write down and organize our words in a bullet point fashion.

You can read the show notes on our [official website](https://www.radiolanza.com). Also below you'll find a series of posts covering announcements, ideas, and updates around the podcast itself.
