[Radio Lanza](https://www.radiolanza.com) is a podcast co-hosted by Jimmy Flores and Marc Collado encouraging entrepreneurs to launch their projects. In each episode, we share personal experiences on how to turn ideas into products, creating a structured educational toolkit along the way.

The show seeks to inspire future entrepreneurs in their next venture while sparing them some of the mistakes we've personally made. We do it through interviews with insightful guests, dissecting nerdy topics, but above all, sharing our controversial opinions around the products we love.
