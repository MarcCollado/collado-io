In 2011, inadvertently, [I became an entrepreneur](/blog/2013/iomando-prologue). Upon graduating from college, a random idea led me to co-found iomando technologies — a startup pioneering keyless access management for mobile devices. Which in plain English means opening doors and other stuff with your phone.

Late in 2017, the company ended up acquired by [Citibox](https://www.citibox.com/), that integrated iomando's technology into their core product: parcel boxes to receive online purchases.

## ⚡️ Highlights

- Built and launched the [first version of the product](/blog/2013/iomando-10)
- Hired, scaled, and led both the product and engineering teams
- Raised a seed round of 300.000€ with local angels and early-stage funds
- Featured as 30 under 30 by Entrepreneur Magazine in 2015
