In 2011, at age 24, and right after finishing my [master's degree in Industrial Engineering](/blog/2013/industrial-engineer), inadvertently, [I became an entrepreneur](/blog/2013/iomando-prologue).

A random idea led me to co-found iomando technologies ‚Äî a startup pioneering keyless access management for mobile devices. A product that allowed users to open a wide range of locks with their smartphones. Becoming one of the first IoT projects to successfully integrate with the nascent mobile ecosystem.

Late in 2017, the company ended up acquired by [Citibox](https://www.citibox.com/). Which utilized iomando's technology to digitize and power their parcel boxes to receive online purchases.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Highlights

- Built and launched the [first version of the product](/blog/2013/iomando-10)
- Hired, scaled, and led the product and engineering teams
- Brought the company to two successful funding rounds
- Featured as 30 under 30 by Entrepreneur Magazine in 2015
