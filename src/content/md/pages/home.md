Hello there, I'm Marc — family guy, born and raised in Barcelona, but also...

- ✍️ [Aspiring writer](/blog) and 🎙 [irregular podcaster](https://www.safareig.fm)
- 📚 [Book nerd](/books) and ⌨️ [programmer aficionado](https://github.com/marccollado)
- 🎲 [Accidental enrepreneur](/work) and 🏗 [product enthusiast](https://linkedin.com/in/marccollado)

And as you might have guessed by now, 📑 list lover, 🔥 emoji maniac, and helpless minimalist.

ℹ️ To know more about what I am currently up to, check out my [now page](/now). Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://twitter.com/sivers) and the [nownownow](https://nownownow.com/) project.
