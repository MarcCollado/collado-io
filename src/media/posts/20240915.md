## The phonograph keynote

When Edison first presented the phonograph to Scientific American, the audience was stunned by its ability to say a simple "hello." This moment parallels modern-day tech keynotes, like Apple product launches, where innovation shocks the public, only to become normalized rapidly.

It serves as a reminder that today's jaw-dropping advancements will likely seem trivial or outdated soon. Just as Scientific American was amazed by the phonograph, today's innovations will eventually lose their novelty as we integrate them into our daily lives.

Within a few years, we might view current interfaces as primitive, much like how the phonograph's early days now seem simplistic compared to streaming services or AI assistants.

## Spotify's grandfather

It's fascinating that as early as the 19th century, people like Joseph Hippel envisioned telephones being used to stream music into homes, much like modern music streaming services.

Edison's phonograph ultimately paved the way for this concept, although he didn't immediately grasp its potential for music distribution. His initial focus remained on telegraphy.

## Focus on the market's needs

Edison's first invention, the legislative vote recorder, was a technical marvel but failed because he didn't understand the needs of its market. Politicians rejected it as they preferred slower voting processes that allowed time for lobbying.

This failure taught Edison that even the most brilliant innovations must align with user needs.

## Edison as the first celebrity inventor

Before Edison, celebrities were primarily political and military figures. Edison pioneered the modern concept of a celebrity inventor, a role he leveraged by constantly engaging with the media.

He understood the power of public interest in his work, which helped him secure financial backing and public support for his inventions. It was this blend of technological achievement and media savviness that made him one of the first true celebrity figures in the way we understand fame today.

This is akin to today's tech figures, such as Elon Musk, who masterfully use public attention and media to fuel their businesses.

## ICE vs. electric car

The relationship between Thomas Edison and Henry Ford was one of mutual admiration and deep friendship that lasted over several decades.

While Edison initially supported the idea of electric cars, it was Ford's success with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles that shaped the automotive industry. Despite this, Ford never stopped admiring Edison and continued to support his work and legacy.

One notable collaboration came in 1914 when Ford helped finance Edison's research into electric car batteries. However, the collaboration didn't yield the results they had hoped, and electric cars didn't take off as they had envisioned at that time.
