## Side projects

Over the last years, I built, developed, and published a few little products such as:

- 🎙 [Foc a Terra](https://rss.com/podcasts/focaterra/): a weekly discussion on the technological landscape.
- 👨‍💻 [Nutri-Score Auditor](https://nutriscore.app/): a web-based tool to optimize Nutri-Score ratings.
- 🎙 [Safareig](https://www.safareig.fm): a podcast about how technology is changing society.
- 🎙 [Radio Lanza](https://www.radiolanza.com): an educational series on how to launch a tech startup.

Besides these side projects, I sometimes blog my thoughts on pretty much everything. If you enjoy my content, consider subscribing to my [RSS feed](https://www.collado.io/rss.xml) to stay up-to-date with my latest developments.

## Now

This last section is also a [/now page](https://nownownow.com/p/YAnl), inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org) and the [nownownow](https://nownownow.com) project.

Here you will find whatever I am currently doing, reading, learning, building... and keeps me awake at night, timely updated every now and then.
