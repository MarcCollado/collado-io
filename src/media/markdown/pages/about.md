## Now

This last section is a [/now page](https://nownownow.com/p/YAnl), inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org) and the [nownownow](https://nownownow.com) project. Here you will find whatever I am currently doing, reading, learning, building... and keeps me awake at night — timely updated every now and then.

- Book: When Coffee and Kale Compete
