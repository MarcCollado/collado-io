Over the last years, I created a few things. Some have worked, others have not.

## Work

- 2022 — [Wiz Music](https://www.wizmusic.com/): a web3 platform for music artists to connect with their fans.
- 2019 — [Gamestry](https://www.gamestry.com/): the largest video gaming community in Spain and South America.
- 2015 — [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/) BCN: one of the main coding bootcamp across Europe and America.
- 2011 — [iomando](https://www.iomando.com/): a keyless access management for mobile; acquired by [Citibox](https://citibox.com/).

## Side projects

- 🎙 [Foc a Terra](https://rss.com/podcasts/focaterra/): a weekly discussion around the current technological landscape.
- 👨‍💻 [Nutri-Score Auditor](https://nutriscore.app/): a web-based tool to optimize Nutri-Score ratings.
- 🎙 [Safareig](https://www.safareig.fm): a podcast about how technology is changing society.
- 🎙 [Radio Lanza](https://www.radiolanza.com): an educational series on how to launch a tech startup.

Besides these side projects, I sometimes blog my thoughts on pretty much everything. If you enjoy these writings, consider subscribing to [the RSS feed](https://www.collado.io/rss.xml) and stay up-to-date with my latest developments.

## Now

This last section is also a [/now page](https://nownownow.com/p/YAnl), inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org) and the [nownownow](https://nownownow.com) project. Here you will find whatever I am currently doing, reading, learning, building... and keeps me awake at night — timely updated every now and then.

- Book: [The Order of Time](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0141984961) by Carlo Rovelli.
- Audiobook: [Do Nothing](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984824732) by Celeste Headlee.
