Industrial Engineer by trade. I build products for a living. Over the last years, I created a few things. Some have worked, others have not.

My days revolve around products, technology, design, and podcasting. However, as a helpless [generalist](/blog/2020/generalists), I've also developed a deep curiosity about health, engineering, physics, and minimalism — which have become the main themes of this blog.

## Now

This last section is a [/now page](https://nownownow.com/p/YAnl), inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org) and the [nownownow](https://nownownow.com) project. Here you will find whatever I am currently doing, reading, learning, building... and keeps me awake at night — timely updated every now and then.

- Reading Tim Urban's book: [What's Our Problem?](https://waitbutwhy.com/2023/02/last-six-years.html)
- Curious about the latest advancements in AI and their implications for society. Maybe that's the reason why I started to brush up on my Python skills.
- Working on a small side-project: a notification system for when someone you follow appears on a podcast.
