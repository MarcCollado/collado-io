Besides these side-projects, I sometimes blog my thoughts on pretty much everything. If you enjoy these lines, consider subscribing to [the RSS feed](https://www.collado.io/rss.xml) to stay up-to-date with my latest developments.

## Now

This last section is a [/now page](https://nownownow.com/p/YAnl), inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org). Here you will find whatever I am currently doing, reading, learning, building... and keeps me awake at night — timely updated every now and then.

- Reading: [Novacene](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BT4MM18/) and [Infocracy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09SVTP9RS/)
- Curious about the latest advancements in AI and their implications for society.
- Working on a notification system for when someone you follow appears on a podcast.

Last updated on October 27. You can also revisit past editions of the [/now project](/tags/now), back when it still was a standalone page.
