Product maker. Jack-of-all-trades, master of none.

I've been an [entrepreneur](/about), [podcaster](/blog/2022/foc-a-terra), [writer](/blog), [programmer](https://github.com/marccollado), and [fitness aficionado](/blog/2018/going-sub3).

I'm a [lifelong learner](/blog/2019/til), curious, perseverant, rational, optimist, introvert, and minimalist.

Born and raised in Barcelona.

To know more about me and what I'm up to, [head over here](/about).
