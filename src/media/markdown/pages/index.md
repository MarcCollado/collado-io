I'm a family guy, born, raised, and based in Barcelona. I'm currently working on [Wiz Music](https://www.wizmusic.io). Other than that ...

- [Aspiring writer](/blog) and [weekly podcaster](https://podcasts.apple.com/es/podcast/foc-a-terra/id1604172036)
- [Book nerd](/tags/books) and [avid runner](https://www.strava.com/athletes/marccollado)
- [Helpless builder](/about) and [programmer aficionado](https://github.com/marccollado)

And as you might have guessed by now, list lover and confessed minimalist.

To know more about me and what I'm currently up to, [head over here](/about).
