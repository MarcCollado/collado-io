> Principles are fundamental truths that serve as the foundations for behavior that gets you what you want out of life. They can be applied again and again in similar situations to help you achieve your goals.

To be principled means to consistently operate with principles that can be clearly explained.

The key to success lies in knowing how to both strive for a lot and fail well ‚Äî¬†being able to experience painful failures that provide big learnings without failing badly enough to get knocked out of the game.

The most important thing you can do is to gather the lessons these failures provide and gain humility and radical open-mindedness in order to increase your chances of success.

Successful people change in ways that allow them to continue to take advantage of their strengths while compensating for their weaknesses and unsuccessful people don‚Äôt.

Knowing that I could be painfully wrong and curiosity about why other smart people saw things differently prompted me to look at things through the eyes of others as well as my own. That allowed me to see many more dimensions than if I saw things just through my own eyes.

Almost everyone expects the future to be a slightly modified version of the present, it is usually very different.

Whatever success I‚Äôve had in life has had more to do with my knowing how to deal with my not knowing than anything I know. You can never be sure of anything: there are always risks out there that can hurt you badly, even in the seemingly safest bets, so it‚Äôs always best to assume you‚Äôre missing something.

You better make sense of what happened to other people in other times and other places because if you don‚Äôt you won‚Äôt know if these things can happen to you and, if they do, you won‚Äôt know how to deal with them.

Start with what you really want, which are your real goals, and then work back to what you need to attain them. My business has always been a way to get me into exotic places and allow me to meet interesting people. Meaningful work is being on a mission I become engrossed in, and meaningful relationships are those I have with people I care deeply about and who care deeply about me.

‚Äî

I could either take on a lot of risk in pursuit of high returns (and occasionally find myself ruined) or I could lower my risk and settle for lower returns. But I needed to have both low risk and high returns, and by setting out on a mission to discover how I could, I learned to go slowly when faced with the choice between two things that you need that are seemingly at odds.

While the computer was much better than our brains in many ways, it didn‚Äôt have the imagination, understanding, and logic that we did. That‚Äôs why our brains working with the computer made such a great partnership.

I believe one of the most valuable things you can do to improve your decision making is to think through your principles for making decisions, write them out in both words and computer algorithms, back-test them if possible, and use them on a real-time basis to run in parallel with your brain‚Äôs decision making.

Approaching the market in this way taught me that one of the keys to being a successful investor is to only take bets you are highly confident in and to diversify them well.

I learned that if you work hard and creatively, you can have just about anything you want, but not everything you want. Maturity is the ability to reject good alternatives in order to pursue even better ones.

There was and still is no leader I admire more than Lee Kuan Yew, who transformed Singapore from a mosquito-infested backwater to a model economy.

He rated Angela Merkel as the best leader in the West and considered Vladimir Putin one of the best leaders worldwide. He explained that leaders must be judged within the context of the circumstances they encounter and then went on to share his view of how difficult it is to lead Russia and why he thought Putin was doing it well. He also reflected on his unique relationship with Deng Xiaoping, whom he regarded as the best leader of all.

I love getting to know interesting people from interesting places and seeing the world through their eyes. This is true whether they are rich or poor.

Encounters like these have taught me that human greatness and terribleness are not correlated with wealth or other conventional measures of success. I‚Äôve also learned that judging people before really seeing things through their eyes stands in the way of understanding their circumstances‚Äîand that isn‚Äôt smart. I urge you to be curious enough to want to understand how the people who see things differently from you came to see them that way.

I had always wanted to have‚Äîand to be around people who also wanted to have‚Äîa life full of meaningful work and meaningful relationships, and to me a meaningful relationship is one that‚Äôs open and honest in a way that lets people be straight with each other. I never valued more traditional, antiseptic relationships where people put on a fa√ßade of politeness and don‚Äôt say what they really think.

Having a few good uncorrelated return streams is better than having just one, and knowing how to combine return streams is even more effective than being able to choose good ones (though of course you have to do both).

Making a handful of good uncorrelated bets that are balanced and leveraged well is the surest way of having a lot of upside without being exposed to unacceptable downside.

What was great is that we made the most of our mistakes because we got in the habit of viewing them as opportunities to learn and improve.

Having a process that ensures problems are brought to the surface, and their root causes diagnosed, assures that continual improvements occur.

There are two parts of each person‚Äôs brain: the upper-level logical part and the lower-level emotional part. I call these the ‚Äútwo yous.‚Äù They fight for control of each person. How that conflict is managed is the most important driver of our behaviors.

They have very strong mental maps of how things should be done, and at the same time a willingness to test those mental maps in the world of reality and change the ways they do things to make them work better.

All are able to see both big pictures and granular details (and levels in between) and synthesize the perspectives they gain at those different levels, whereas most people see just one or the other. They are simultaneously creative, systematic, and practical. They are assertive and open-minded at the same time. Above all, they are passionate about what they are doing, intolerant of people who work for them who aren‚Äôt excellent at what they do, and want to have a big, beneficial impact on the world.

Those that do best both see a wide range themselves while triangulating well with other brilliant people who see things in different, complementary ways.

This exercise reminded me that there are far fewer types of people in the world than there are people and far fewer different types of situations than there are situations, so matching the right types of people to the right types of situations is key.

There is nothing more important than understanding how reality works and how to deal with it. The state of mind you bring to this process makes all the difference. I have found it helpful to think of my life as if it were a game in which each problem I face is a puzzle I need to solve. By solving the puzzle, I get a gem in the form of a principle that helps me avoid the same sort of problem in the future.

I‚Äôm still scared of the crashes and I still find them painful. But I keep that pain in perspective, knowing that I will get through these setbacks and that most of my learning will come from reflecting on them.

Dreams + Reality + Determination = A Successful Life. People who achieve success and drive progress deeply understand the cause-effect relationships that govern reality and have principles for using them to get what they want.

1.2¬†Truth‚Äîor, more precisely, an accurate understanding of reality‚Äîis the essential foundation for any good outcome.

Radical open-mindedness and radical transparency are invaluable for rapid learning and effective change. Learning is the product of a continuous real-time feedback loop in which we make decisions, see their outcomes, and improve our understanding of reality as a result.

1.4¬†Look to nature to learn how reality works. All the laws of reality were given to us by nature. Man didn‚Äôt create these laws, but by understanding them we can use them to foster our own evolution and achieve our goals. For example, our ability to fly or to send cell phone signals around the world came from understanding and applying the existing rules of reality‚Äîthe physical laws or principles that govern the natural world. While I spend most of my time studying the realities that affect me most directly‚Äîthose that drive economies, the markets, and the people I deal with‚ÄîI also spend time in nature and can‚Äôt help reflecting on how it works by observing, reading, and speaking with some of the greatest specialists on the subject. I‚Äôve found it both interesting and valuable to observe which laws we humans have in common with the rest of nature and which differentiate us. Doing that has had a big impact on my approach to life.

the evolution of the brain gave man a much more developed neocortex, which gives us the power to think abstractly and logically.

By looking at nature from the top down, we can see that much of what we call human nature is really animal nature. That‚Äôs because the human brain is programmed with millions of years of genetic learning that we share with other species.

While mankind is very intelligent in relation to other species, we have the intelligence of moss growing on a rock compared to nature as a whole. We are incapable of designing and building a mosquito, let alone all the species and most of the other things in the universe.

nature optimizes for the whole, not for the individual, but most people judge good and bad based only on how it affects them.

To be ‚Äúgood‚Äù something must operate consistently with the laws of reality and contribute to the evolution of the whole; that is what is most rewarded. For example, if you come up with something the world values, you almost can‚Äôt help but be rewarded. Conversely, reality tends to penalize those people, species, and things that don‚Äôt work well and detract from evolution.

Evolution is the single greatest force in the universe; it is the only thing that is permanent and it drives everything.

Evolution is good because it is the process of adaptation that generally moves things toward improvement. All things such as products, organizations, and human capabilities evolve through time in a similar way. It is simply the process by which things either adapt and improve or die.

If nature, or anything, were perfect it wouldn‚Äôt be evolving. Organisms, organizations, and individual people are always highly imperfect but capable of improving. So rather than getting stuck hiding our mistakes and pretending we‚Äôre perfect, it makes sense to find our imperfections and deal with them.

The key is to fail, learn, and improve quickly. If you‚Äôre constantly learning and improving, your evolutionary process will look like the one that‚Äôs ascending. Do it poorly and it will look like what you see on the left, or worse. I believe that: 1.5¬†Evolving is life‚Äôs greatest accomplishment and its greatest reward.

I now find it thrilling to embrace reality, to look down on myself through nature‚Äôs perspective, and to be an infinitesimally small part of the whole. My instinctual and intellectual goal is simply to evolve and contribute to evolution in some tiny way while I‚Äôm here and while I am what I am. At the same time, the things I love most‚Äîmy work and my relationships‚Äîare what motivate me. So, I find how reality and nature work, including how I and everything will decompose and recompose, beautiful‚Äîthough emotionally I find the separation from those I care about difficult to appreciate.

When I began to look at reality through the perspective of figuring out how it really works, instead of thinking things should be different, I realized that most everything that at first seemed ‚Äúbad‚Äù to me‚Äîlike rainy days, weaknesses, and even death‚Äîwas because I held preconceived notions of what I personally wanted.

I believe that the need to have meaningful work is connected to man‚Äôs innate desire to improve. And relationships are the natural connections to others that make us relevant to each other and to society more broadly.

It is a fundamental law of nature that in order to gain strength one has to push one‚Äôs limits, which is painful. As Carl Jung put it, ‚ÄúMan needs difficulties. They are necessary for health.‚Äù Yet most people instinctually avoid pain. This is true whether we are talking about building the body (e.g., weight lifting) or the mind (e.g., frustration, mental struggle, embarrassment, shame)‚Äîand especially true when people confront the harsh reality of their own imperfections.

If you don‚Äôt let up on yourself and instead become comfortable always operating with some level of pain, you will evolve at a faster pace. That‚Äôs just the way it is. Every time you confront something painful, you are at a potentially important juncture in your life‚Äîyou

At some point in your life you will crash in a big way. You might fail at your job or with your family, lose a loved one, suffer a serious accident or illness, or discover the life you imagined is out of reach forever. There are a whole host of ways that something will get you. At such times, you will be in pain and might think that you don‚Äôt have the strength to go on. You almost always do, however; your ultimate success will depend on you realizing that fact, even though it might not seem that way at the moment.

No matter what you want out of life, your ability to adapt and move quickly and efficiently through the process of personal evolution will determine your success and your happiness.

I‚Äôve come to see that people who overweigh the first-order consequences of their decisions and ignore the effects of second- and subsequent-order consequences rarely reach their goals.

So don‚Äôt worry about whether you like your situation or not. Life doesn‚Äôt give a damn about what you like. It‚Äôs up to you to connect what you want with what you need to do to get it and then find the courage to carry it through.

Asking others who are strong in areas where you are weak to help you is a great skill that you should develop no matter what, as it will help you develop guardrails that will prevent you from doing what you shouldn‚Äôt be doing. All successful people are good at this.

First you have to pick what you are going after‚Äîyour goals. Your choice of goals will determine your direction. As you move toward them, you will encounter problems. Some of those problems will bring you up against your own weaknesses. How you react to the pain that causes is up to you. If you want to reach your goals, you must be calm and analytical so that you can accurately diagnose your problems, design a plan that will get you around them, and do what‚Äôs necessary to push through to results.

While you can have virtually anything you want, you can‚Äôt have everything you want.

Don‚Äôt get discouraged and don‚Äôt let yourself be paralyzed by all the choices. You can have much more than what you need to be happy. Make your choice and get on with it.

Remember that great expectations create great capabilities. If you limit your goals to what you know you can achieve, you are setting the bar way too low.

a.¬†Focus on the ‚Äúwhat is‚Äù before deciding ‚Äúwhat to do about it.‚Äù It is a common mistake to move in a nanosecond from identifying a tough problem to proposing a solution for it. Strategic thinking requires both diagnosis and design.

b.¬†Distinguish proximate causes from root causes. Proximate causes are typically the actions (or lack of actions) that lead to problems, so they are described with verbs (I missed the train because I didn‚Äôt check the train schedule). Root causes run much deeper and they are typically described with adjectives (I didn‚Äôt check the train schedule because I am forgetful).

b.¬†Think about your problem as a set of outcomes produced by a machine. Practice higher-level thinking by looking down on your machine and thinking about how it can be changed to produce better outcomes.

a.¬†Great planners who don‚Äôt execute their plans go nowhere. You need to push through and that requires self-discipline to follow your script.

c.¬†Establish clear metrics to make certain that you are following your plan. Ideally, someone other than you should be objectively measuring and reporting on your progress.

The two biggest barriers to good decision making are your ego and your blind spots.

reside in primitive parts of your brain such as the amygdala, which are structures in your temporal lobe that process emotions. Because these areas of your brain are not accessible to your conscious awareness, it is virtually impossible for you to understand what they want and how they control you.

higher-level consciousness resides in your neocortex, more specifically in the part called the prefrontal cortex. This is the most distinctively human feature of your brain; relative to the rest of the brain, it‚Äôs larger in humans than in most other species. This is where you experience the conscious awareness of decision making (the so-called ‚Äúexecutive function‚Äù), as well as the application of logic and reasoning.

b.¬†Your two ‚Äúyous‚Äù fight to control you. It‚Äôs like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, though your higher-level you is not aware of your lower-level you. This conflict is universal; if you pay close enough attention, you can actually see when the different parts of a person‚Äôs brain are arguing with one another.

Once you understand how your a) logical/conscious you and b) emotional/subconscious you fight with each other, you can imagine what it‚Äôs like when your two yous deal with other people and their own two ‚Äúthems.‚Äù It‚Äôs a mess.

Differences in thinking can be symbiotic and complementary instead of disruptive. For example, the lateral approach to thinking common among creative people can lead them to be unreliable, while more linear thinkers are often more dependable; some people are more emotional while others are more logical, and so on. None of these individuals would be able to succeed at any kind of complex project without the help of others who have complementary strengths.

recognize that your ability to deal well with ‚Äúnot knowing‚Äù is more important than whatever it is you do know.

Taking in others‚Äô perspectives in order to consider them in no way reduces your freedom to think independently and make your own decisions. It will just broaden your perspective as you make them.

c.¬†Don‚Äôt worry about looking good; worry about achieving your goal. People typically try to prove that they have the answer even when they don‚Äôt.

e.¬†Recognize that to gain the perspective that comes from seeing things through another‚Äôs eyes, you must suspend judgment for a time‚Äîonly by empathizing can you properly evaluate another point of view. Open-mindedness doesn‚Äôt mean going along with what you don‚Äôt believe in; it means considering the reasoning of others instead of stubbornly and illogically holding on to your own point of view. To be radically open-minded, you need to be so open to the possibility that you could be wrong that you encourage others to tell you so.

I define believable people as those who have repeatedly and successfully accomplished the thing in question‚Äîwho have a strong track record with at least three successes‚Äîand have great explanations of their approach when probed.

Remember, you are not arguing; you are openly exploring what‚Äôs true.

My point is that you can significantly raise your probabilities of making the right decisions by open-mindedly triangulating with believable people.

Open-minded people are more curious about why there is disagreement.

Open-minded people genuinely believe they could be wrong; the questions that they ask are genuine.

Open-minded people always feel compelled to see things through others‚Äô eyes.

Open-minded people are always more interested in listening than in speaking; they encourage others to voice their views.

some parts of our brains cannot be materially affected by external experience (in the same way that your skeleton isn‚Äôt changed much through working out), while other parts can be strengthened through exercise

The experience not only taught me a lot about how brains work but why creative genius often exists at the edge of insanity. Many highly productive and creative people have suffered from bipolar disorder, among them Ernest Hemingway, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Vincent van Gogh, Jackson Pollock, Virginia Woolf, Winston Churchill, and the psychologist Kay Redfield Jamison

1. the biggest threat to good decision making is harmful emotions, and 2) decision making is a two-step process (first learning and then deciding).

Yellow highlight | Page: 236
Deciding is the process of choosing which knowledge should be drawn upon‚Äîboth the facts of this particular ‚Äúwhat is‚Äù and your broader understanding of the cause-effect machinery that underlies it‚Äîand then weighing them to determine a course of action, the ‚Äúwhat to do about it.‚Äù This involves playing different scenarios through time to visualize how to get an outcome consistent with what you want. To do this well, you need to weigh first-order consequences against second- and third-order consequences, and base your decisions not just on near-term results but on results over time.

Yellow highlight | Page: 236
Failing to consider second- and third-order consequences is the cause of a lot of painfully bad decisions, and it is especially deadly when the first inferior option confirms your own biases. Never seize on the first available option, no matter how good it seems, before you‚Äôve asked questions and explored. To prevent myself from falling into this trap, I used to literally ask myself questions: Am I learning? Have I learned enough yet that it‚Äôs time for deciding? After a while, you will just naturally and open-mindedly gather all the relevant info, but in doing so you will have avoided the first pitfall of bad decision making, which is to subconsciously make the decision first and then cherry-pick the data that supports it.
