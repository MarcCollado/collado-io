Last week I jotted down some [notes about the Metaverse](/blog/2021/07) in preparation for an [upcoming Safareig episode](https://www.safareig.fm/26). All those thoughts about constructing an alternate reality inevitably led me to wonder if we all live in a nested simulation and we are doing nothing but creating the next layer.

This post (of course) does not hold the answer to the conundrum nor adds new information to the conversation. I'm not a trained physicist, not even close. Its only purpose is to pin down the ideas that I entertain and make some sense to the uneducated mind.

- Looking back 100 years ago at the first movies, and today's

  - If we assume any rate of improvement at all, games will become indistinguishable from reality.

-
- Computing power is going up — The day we can recreate live in a computer + the perception of free will
  - You just need the amount of land people is watching
- Maybe because we can't go faster than the speed of light
- Movies => videogames => ??? it is not safe to assume that we'll get there?
- The world evolves => and they make a world ...
- If we take into account a given rate of improvement at all games will become indistiguishable for reality — or civilization will end
- Statistically, where are we living (baisan statistics)

- We've been here for 200.000 years — nothing in terms of how old is the universe

NPC (non-player characters)
RPG (we exist outside the simulation
only when it is observed, is rendered
make it funny so the simulators don't shut us down
