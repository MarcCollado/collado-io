## Ideas I've shared

- Peter Attia has had a huge influence on the development of my nutritional and fitness regimes. I've always liked his pragmatic point of view and data-driven approach to science. For example, his elegant [three-dimension nutritional framework](https://peterattiamd.com/my-nutritional-framework/) gracefully depicts the levers at reach for dietary regulation. This time around, [in his latest appearance in the Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/2021/06/08/peter-attia-2/), he nerds out about the structural benefits of improving movement by focusing on the four components of exercise: stability, strength, aerobic efficiency, and anaerobic performance.
- Do you know that feeling when somebody acutely writes down something you had a sense of but always struggled to pin down? This is exactly what Julie Zhuo has done in [her recent post at Future](https://future.a16z.com/product-thinking/), the brand new a16z' publication. In there, she goes deep into what she calls Product Thinking, or _the skill of knowing what makes a product useful — and loved — by people_.

## Things I was into

- This week I've been over the moon, not just figuratively, but almost literally. This is because I've finally completed the [LEGO NASA Apollo Saturn V](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-nasa-apollo-saturn-v-21309). For almost three months I've indulged myself with a single building chapter each week to lengthen its construction delight. To set the mood, I also re-listened to [The Man Who Knew the Way to the Moon](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Man-Who-Knew-the-Way-to-the-Moon-Audiobook/B07T1F4MB7), an Audible Original about the story of John C. Houbolt.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TIL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TIL</a> the Space Task Group was initially favoring direct ascent, instead of Lunar orbit rendezvous, as the procedure for landing humans on the Moon. It was only after engineer John Houbolt&#39; endless perseverance — and public discredit — that it was taken into consideration.</p>&mdash; Marc Collado (@MarcCollado) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcCollado/status/1159517978712559616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2019</a></blockquote>

- From time to time I revisit this [classic of mine](https://www.raptitude.com/2010/07/your-lifestyle-has-already-been-designed/). I'd say I've been struggling with this for years now. Yet whenever I feel like some of us are spending more than 60 hours a week solely optimizing for the only asset we shouldn't care as much and already have more than we need to (capital L) Live, I pull this one out to bring some sanity across the board.
