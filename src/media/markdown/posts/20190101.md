excerpt: "This year will start by consolidating and doubling down on the 2018' themes: training, making — i.e. coding, and reading; but with a slightly different focus."

## Training

Keeping up with the ~~obsession~~ goal of [running a marathon under three hours](/blog/2018/going-sub3). The next stop, after [missing the 3h15min mark](https://www.strava.com/activities/1996244257) — just by 39 seconds — in Valencia, will be the [Sevilla Marathon](http://www.zurichmaratonsevilla.es/) on the 17th of February and my hometown' [Barcelona Marathon](https://www.zurichmaratobarcelona.es/) on the 10th of March.

Both Sevilla and Barcelona should be clocking somewhere between 3h10min and 3h15min, the closer to the former, the better.

## Making

A [growing discontent](/blog/2018/broken-notes) with note-taking apps has recently gotten all my attention, to the extent that I've decided to create [my own thing](/blog/2019/productizing-hacks).

I'm still not sure where this is going. It could end up nowhere with "yet another" note-taking app, finding out it simply can't be done. Or maybe, just maybe, creating an amazing product that solves all my note-related pains.

What I do know is that it might become one of the most delightful side-projects I have ever worked on and that I'll be having the time of my life building it.

## Reading

I want to keep on reading a couple of books per month, but also reinstate the practice of publishing my [book notes](/blog/2019/upgrading-books) — even if they aren't extremely polished.

Early 2019, these will be my eight (+1) book pickings:

- [Stumbling on Happiness](/blog/2019/stumbling-on-happiness)
- [Predictably Irrational](/blog/2019/predictably-irrational)
- [Fooled by Randomness](/blog/2019/fooled-by-randomness)
- [Atomic Habits](/blog/2019/atomic-habits)
- [The Power of Habit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006WAIV6M/)
- [Hooked](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NW01MKM/)
- [Creative Selection](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079DVT6VP/)
