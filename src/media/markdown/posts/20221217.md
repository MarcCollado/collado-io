The term [Renaissance man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath#Renaissance_man) or polymath — inspired by Renaissance creators — is often used to designate a breed of people whose skills span across a wide range of domains. Two of the highest examples from that time were Leonardo da Vinci, a painter but also a scientist, philosopher, engineer, and mathematician; and Michelangelo, an extraordinary sculptor, painter, architect and poet.

However, [the complexity of today's products](/blog/2022/fat44) can make it difficult for individuals to become proficient in multiple areas. Starting and running a successful business often requires a team with specialized skills and expertise. This is especially true for technology companies, which often required a combination of software developers, designers, and marketers to bring a product to market.

For example, developing a complex software product may require expertise in multiple programming languages, as well as a deep understanding of user experience design and data analytics. Similarly, marketing a product may require a combination of creative thinking, data analysis, and social media savvy. As a result, many businesses rely on teams of specialists to handle these tasks.

## The Solo Founder

This trend, though, is about to change and bring back the figure of the Renaissance man for the modern era — the solo founder.

New tools have made it easier for people to handle a wider range of tasks and responsibilities — handing-off to the repetitive and time-consuming tasks, or simply the ones that aren't their strong suit.

Additionally, the increasing availability and accessibility of online learning resources has made it easier for curious minds to continuously improve their skills and knowledge. By leveraging these resources, solo founders can quickly become proficient in multiple areas, even if they do not have formal training or education.

Now is an exciting time to be a [solo founder](/2020/generalists).

## The Rise of AI

Advances in AI and other technological tools have made it possible for individuals to create products and businesses that may have previously required a team. One of the key benefits of these tools is their ability to automate certain tasks and processes, freeing up time and resources for founders to focus on other areas of their business.

In addition to automation, AI tools can also provide solo founders with access to advanced capabilities that may have been out of reach in the past. For example, a solo founder with limited design skills can use [AI-powered design tools](https://stability.ai/) to create professional-quality graphics and marketing materials. Similarly, AI-powered language translation tools can be used to expand their reach and connect with global markets.

On top of that, the rise of the gig economy and the increasing popularity of remote work have made it easier than ever to build a network of freelancers and contractors to help with specific tasks or projects, rather than having to build a full-time team. These tools can also help solo founders scale their businesses more efficiently, as they can handle a larger volume of work without requiring additional human labor.

Overall, the combination of automation, advanced capabilities, and the gig economy has made it easier for solo founders to build new thriving businesses. As a result, now is an exciting time for entrepreneurs, creators, and product generalists to pursue their passions and turn their ideas into reality.
