## Training

I'm back to the running track and (seriously) preparing to [run a sub 3h marathon](/blog/2018/going-sub3) sometime next year.

By the end of the year, I hope to get my marks back down to 40min for 10km and 1h25min for half marathon.

I'll also be running the [Valencia Marathon](https://www.valenciaciudaddelrunning.com/maraton/maraton/) on the 2nd of December — hopefully under 3h15min.

You can [follow me on Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/marccollado) to know how am I doing...

## Making

After finishing the [DAND](/blog/2018/udacity-dand) and the [RDND](/blog/2018/udacity-rdnd), Udacity offered the possibility to [become a mentor](https://www.udacity.com/start-mentoring) for future students of their programs.

I was hesitant at first because such commitment would occupy a lot of time. But the idea of giving back and helping out other students achieve their goals definitely won me over and I decided to start mentoring Udacity students on the React Nanodegree.

On top of that, I'll be wrapping up other "unfinished" projects of mine:

- Complete [the moving](/blog/2018/moving-collado-io) of collado.io.
- Finish both [ES6](https://es6.io/) and [JS30](https://javascript30.com/) Wes Bos courses that I started early this summer.
- Read for once and for all [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) — tried several times before, but never managed to commit until the end.

## Reading

I want to maintain the healthy habit of reading a couple of books per month. My late 2018 picks will double down on a topic that has recently caught my attention: the intersection of physics and psychology.

- [A Brief History of Time](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0031RDVMI/) and [The Grand Design](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00422LESE/) — I read these two a while ago (back in college actually...) and I hope that re-reading them will get me in a "quantum mood" to start with the psychology stuff.
- [Thinking Fast and Slow](/blog/2018/thinking-fast-and-slow) and [The Undoing Project](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GI6S7EK/) — I read the former a few years ago and it profoundly changed the way I approach decision making, period. Recently, a friend of mine told me about a Michael Lewis book that narrated the twisted relationship between Daniel and Amos. I couldn't resist the "temptation" so I'm going for both.
- [The War of Art](/blog/2018/war-of-art) and [Man's Search For Meaning](https://www.amazon.com/dp/080701429X/) — Everybody keeps on recommending these two and now it is the time to go get them. Bonus: nicely aligned with the psychology theme.
- [Measure What Matters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078X4HKS9/) and [12 Rules For Life](/blog/2018/12-rules-for-life) — Finally, not really the type of book I'd actively seek by myself, but these are Ironhack's Book Club picks for the month... so I have no choice.
