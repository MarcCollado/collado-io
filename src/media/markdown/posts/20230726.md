Earlier this year, I got hooked on "The Essays" by Michel de Montaigne, all thanks to a nudge from [Jesús Salido](https://twitter.com/jesussalido). Right off the bat, I felt like Montaigne was speaking my language. I mean, this guy from the French Renaissance was dropping life truths and principles that still hit home today.

However, his essays are long and kind of a tough read. That's why I jotted down some key takeaways, akin to the quick summaries I whipped up for both [Nietzche](/blog/2020/34) and [Yuval Noah Harari](/blog/2021/11). Here's a closer look at some of his most prominent ideas.

## A Man of commitment

While many envision Montaigne as a cultured man, sequestered in his library, it's essential to recognize him as deeply involved in the political happenings of his time.

> I have an open disposition, apt to build trust at first encounters. Authenticity and truth are accepted in any era.

## The art of conversation

Montaigne was a lover of genuine conversation. He was not one to engage in debates with the intent to conquer but rather to understand. He believed that sincerity and staying true to one's word had more merit.

> If moral conviction doesn't drive us to honesty, practical reason should.

## Relativism and skepticism:

Montaigne championed the idea of relativism, suggesting that truths are not absolute but are subject to individual perceptions. His writings betray a deep-seated skepticism, doubting the very foundation of human reasoning.

## Embracing human nature

Montaigne urged us to come to terms with our human condition, embracing our imperfections and the unpredictability of life. He subscribed to Heraclitus's idea that everything is in a constant state of flux, making the pursuit of absolute truth elusive. His motto was, _"What do I know?"_, reminding us of the ever-changing nature of reality.

## Aging and mortality:

Montaigne likened aging to a slow, piece-by-piece death. He believed that as we grow older and experience life's gradual losses, the finality of death becomes less shocking. He draws parallels between the potency of youth and the waning strength of old age, using metaphors like a falling tooth as a sign of both aging and impending mortality.

## Contemplating death

Death was a recurring theme in Montaigne's essays, viewing it as an inevitable part of existence. He admired the stoic attitudes of peasants who faced the devastations of wars and plagues with a calm reminiscent of Socrates drinking hemlock.

> To philosophize is to learn to die.

## Purity of the natural state:

In his travels, Montaigne encountered diverse cultures, leading him to challenge the ethnocentrism of his contemporaries. He argued against the notion of cultural superiority, emphasizing mutual respect and understanding. At his core, was a humanist. He celebrated individual freedom, the dignity of each person, and the potential within every human being.

> The men and women of the New World lived better before Columbus discovered them.

Montaigne had an idealized view of the New World, seeing it as closer to the state of nature than the Old World. He believed that the closer one is to nature, the better.

He also expressed concerns about the possible imbalance arising from the convergence of two worlds at distinct developmental stages. Montaigne was skeptical about progress, viewing history cyclically rather than linearly.

> Changing the state of things risks making it worse rather than better.

His skepticism led him to uphold traditions, even if they seemed arbitrary.

Montaigne encouraged returning to natural behavior, criticizing societal constructs that deviate from it. He denounced the cruelty he witnessed, particularly in religious wars, emphasizing the sanctity of life above all.
