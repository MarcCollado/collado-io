## Found on the news

- We'll probably never know who was the PM behind [this feature](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260639/apple-watch-iphone-unlocked-ios-14-5-app-tracking), but it is genius. It solves a problem affecting almost every iPhone user through the purchase of another Apple device. I'm sure the guy has now an office next to Phil and Craig.

## Ideas I've shared

- Because of the overabundance of content on the Internet, more often than not, we're trapped in an information consumption overload. We skim over an article, watch a video, read a book, listen to a podcast... yet we don't stop and think. I'd argue that [plain thinking](https://alexdanco.com/2021/02/02/the-pirate-problem/) has become one of the most underrated skills in modern society.
- [Eunoia](https://eunoia.world) and words that don't translate. For example, [Schadenfreude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude) refers to the pleasure one takes from watching others' misfortunes. There's no word in English that directly maps to this idea. However, I referred to Schadenfreude on countless occasions. Eunoia is the ultimate aggregator for all these concepts that have a unique meaning in their own language.

- In times of Notions, Airtables, or Codas, trying to come up with the next productivity bundle, this is [the most creative use of Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-UiEeoiV0xBFVZgid63FRaph03OCmHzyEExubn63j0U/edit#heading=h.by5ehyjf5695) I've seen so far.

## Things I was into

- [Products come and go](https://latecheckout.substack.com/p/lessons-learned-from-shutdown-startups). Human needs never change. Every day I'm more convinced that, beyond solving for a real problem and [market readiness](/blog/2014/changing-behavior), timing remains the single most important factor to determine product success.
- This week at Safareig [we spoke about Substack](https://www.safareig.fm/24) and how the dynamics of the Internet are shifting towards a creator-led economy. Even one in which the [creators accrue more value and influence](/blog/2020/youtube-wont-work) than the very platforms its content lives. It is a time for tools, not networks.

## Random thoughts

- ‚òéÔ∏è One of the factors pushing kids back to school during Covid's time was the lack of Internet access at their homes. While this fact won't come as a surprise to some of you, it made me realize that we've probably been living in a "connectivity bubble" for longer than most. Shouldn't it be universal Internet access a fundamental right nowadays?
- üíÖ This podcast raised an [interesting point](https://every.to/means-of-creation/sahil-lavingia-wants-creators-to-842840) about the mental models we generate around office spaces. For example, why is it not OK to work on a side-project while in the office at 11am on a random Tuesday? Somehow we come up with these artificial social contracts in which we blend time, space, and duty under a rigid pattern. I don't have the answer, but I presume it is mostly because of [how we construct our personal values](https://wellnesswisdom.substack.com/p/-wellness-wisdom-vol34-why-we-suffer).
