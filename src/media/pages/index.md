Human being, born and raised in Barcelona, who makes things for a living.

Industrial Engineer by trade, I've been an [entrepreneur](https://linkedin.com/in/MarcCollado), [podcaster](/podcast), [writer](/blog), [programmer](https://github.com/MarcCollado), and [fitness aficionado](https://www.strava.com/athletes/1113999).

[Lifelong learner](/blog/2019/til), curious about [how things work](/blog/2021/learning-framework#how-things-and-the-world-work) and [how humans behave](/blog/2021/learning-framework#how-humans-and-societies-behave). This exploration has drawn me into physics, history, health, or psychology â€” which have become the main themes of this blog.

To know more about me and what I'm up to, [head over here](/about).
