  Marc Collado's personal website

<p align="center">

collado.io is the place where I share random thoughts and conversations on pretty much everything.

Topics ranging from [technology](https://collado.io/tags/tech) and [product](https://collado.io/tags/product); [psychology](https://collado.io/tags/psychology), and how humans behave; [physics](https://collado.io/tags/physics), and how the world works; [health](https://collado.io/tags/health); [engineering](#), particularly on [mobility](https://collado.io/tags/mobility) and supply chains; global [economics](https://collado.io/tags/economics)... and everything in between, you get the idea.

In this README.md file you'll find some (nonessential) insights on the site's inner mechanics. I mostly keep it for myself, but since you're already here, please take a look.
